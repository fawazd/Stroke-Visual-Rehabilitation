# Stroke Visual Rehabilitation

This project consists of various eye tracking games with the intention of applying visual rehab methods for stroke victims with impaired vision. The rehab method applied slowly trains the patient to look towards their visually impaired side as they attempt to complete the objectives of the game. The games have been field tested on real stroke victims, one with locked-in syndrome. We have received positive feedback and constructive suggestions for changes that need to be made.

### Breakout
A recreation of the classic arcade game breakout. The paddle moves based on where the player is looking, the trick to stay in the game is to follow the ball around the screen, that way the paddle stays right below the ball each time.

### 3D Pong
A 3d reimagination of the classic arcade game pong. The paddle moves based on where the player is looking, the same idea applied as above.

### Memory
A recreation of the card game memory. A card can be flipped if the player maintains their gaze on the card for 1 second. The goal is to find matching cards by keeping in mind the cards you have already seen.
